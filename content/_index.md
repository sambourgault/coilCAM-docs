# What is CoilCAM?
![coilcam](./images/coilcam_cool_stuff.png)

A javascript version of the coilCAM system for clay 3D printing, enabling the use of mathematically-defined toolpaths in the generation of parametric forms and surface textures for 3D-printing ceramics. This web tool, originally developed as a visual scripting plug-in for Grasshopper, is developed by the Expressive Computation Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

# Getting Started
The [about]({{< ref "/docs/about/_index.md" >}}) page provides a starting point for building forms with CoilCAM, including a basic video tutorial.

The [tutorial]({{< ref "/docs/tutorial/_index.md" >}}) page demonstrates the effects of different CoilCAM functions using in-browser visualizations.

The [documentation]({{< ref "/docs/documentation/_index.md" >}}) page provides a list of CoilCAM functions, with in-browser examples for each one.

The [quickstart]({{< ref "/docs/quick-start/_index.md" >}}) page demonstrates how to navigate the web editor and Dynamic Toolchains.

The [examples]({{< ref "/docs/examples/_index.md" >}}) page has several example forms created with CoilCAM.
